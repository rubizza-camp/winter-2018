# Homework 1

### Before start

Token for your own task you can get from @BotFather -> /token -> /newbot -> choose a name for your bot. -> profit!
Then put your token in bot.token file and enjoy.

## Usage

1. bundle install
2. run redis-server
3. ruby run.rb
4. open Telegram and find your own bot.
* /start for beginning. Bot greet you with slang of "What's up?"
* /wordplay for getting random wordplay from db
* Cuz bot is dumb he dosen't know other commands. So if you try type smth else - he'll be confused.

Examples

```
Go to @pzh_wordplay_bot and ask smth.
